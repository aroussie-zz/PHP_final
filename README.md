# PHP_finalProject

This is a web application allowing the user to store pictures. It's like an album. The user can add pictures, see them, remove some and edit them. Once the pictures is stored, the user can if he wants apply some filters on them. The application has a login process. An admin role is provided to add or remove any user. I developped the application using the PHP framework Symfony.
